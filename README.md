- Set neural network with number of layers, and size of the nodes
- Choose training partner AI based on algorithm. Also you can choose neural network itself for training.
- You can change trainer AI as you progress training
- Competition: let's see how your neural network performs against AI.
- What additional features would you need to make training more efficient?
